# Credit_Risk_Analysis - Lending Club 

## Overview of the analysis: 

Purpose - Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we have:  oversampled the data with RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms; under-sampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm; and utilized the combinatorial approach of over- and under-sampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. 

Additionally, we introduced two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.

## Results: 

The following bulleted lists describes the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. See screenshots to review results, 

1. RandomOverSampler - the results yielding a moderate recall measure for low risk applicants (0.60)  with a high f1 score. Precision for all models remain relatively constant. This should be noted for the remain models.

## Summary: 

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
